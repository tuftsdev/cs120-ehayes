# Lab 6: DOM

As far as I believe, all aspects of the work have been correctly implemented.
I did not collaborate with anyone during this lab, and I spend 4-6 hours on this lab.
It was interesting to learn about WebVTT and VTTCue and how they handle VideoText events,
but then to realize that it was possible to side-step those standards by adding an event listener
directly to the video element. Gotta love the listener pattern for this kind of thing. :)
