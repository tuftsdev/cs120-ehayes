# Lab 8: The Ride-Hailing Service, part 1

As far as I believe, everything (except for the Performance Optimization Requirements) has been implemented as outlined in the lab assignment.
I did not collaborate with anyone for this lab. I spent approximately 2-3 hours completing this lab, and I learned a lot about Typescript second-hand from the Google Maps API documentation.
I still need to include the impact of performance enhancements in this README, to be pushed to this repository at a later date.
