# Lab 5: Responsive Design

I worked on this lab individually, and used the extra resources in the modules (as well as StackOverflow, and other misc tech sites) 
to complete this lab. 
I did not discuss the lab with anyone, and I spend about four hours (mostly on finagling the @media queries) on this lab.

I found this useful cheatsheet for markdowns that I will keep here for later: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
